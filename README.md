# Ideas
## Architecture
Based on my experience, current solution is similar to ports and adapters approach. Second solution I was thinking about is to use secondary ports (infrastructure folders in domain level) as a separate modules.

Files structure:
com.example.tradeservice.domain

#### user-interface package / ui package
- primary port, entry into my application / domain 

#### infrastructure package
- secondary port, 3rd party systems

## Documentation
- C4, plantUml docs

## Naming convention
After analysis, I would name that service: tradeEnricher / tradeEnrichmentService

## Other
To get to know domain better and document flow, I would do an Event Storming session. 


TODO
- TimeService as a separate bean to manipulate time in tests
- public / package scope approach
- application-test.yaml
